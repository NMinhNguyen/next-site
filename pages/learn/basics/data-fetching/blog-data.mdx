import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout';
import Image from '../../../../components/image';

export const meta = {
  title: 'Data Fetching',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'data-fetching',
  stepId: 'blog-data',
  subtitle: 'Blog Data'
};

We’ll now add blog data to our app using the file system. Each blog post will be a markdown file.

- Create a top-level directory called **`posts`**.
- Inside, create two files: **`dps.md`** and **`pre-rendering.md`**.

Copy the following to `dps.md`:

```md
---
title: 'DPS: Develop, Preview, Ship'
date: '2020-01-02'
---

[ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/) supports the **DPS** workflow: **D**evelop, **P**review, and **S**hip:

- **Develop**: Write code in Next.js. Keep the development server running and take advantage of its hot code reloading feature.
- **Preview**: Every time you push changes to a branch on GitHub / GitLab / BitBucket, ZEIT Now automatically creates a new deployment with a unique URL.
- **Ship**: When you’re ready to ship, merge the pull request to your default branch (e.g. `master`). ZEIT Now will automatically create a production deployment.

By using the DPS workflow, in addition to doing code reviews, you can do _deployment previews_. Each deployment creates a unique URL that can be shared or used for integration tests.
```

Copy the following to `pre-rendering.md`:

```md
---
title: 'Two Forms of Pre-rendering'
date: '2020-01-01'
---

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation (Recommended)**: The HTML is generated at **build time** and will be reused on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering**: The HTML is generated on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form you'd like to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.
```

> You might have noticed that each markdown file has a metadata section at the top containing `title` and `date`. This is called YAML Front Matter, which can be parsed using a library called [gray-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter).

### Parsing the Blog Data on `getStaticProps`

Now, let’s update our index page (`pages/index.js`) using this data. We’d like to:

- Parse each markdown file and get `title`, `date`, and file name (which will be used as `id` for the post URL).
- List the data on the index page, sorted by date.

To do this on pre-render, we need to implement `getStaticProps`.

<Image
  shadow
  alt="Index Page"
  oversize={false}
  src="/static/images/learn/data-fetching/index-page.png"
  width={1246 / 2}
  height={948 / 2}
/>

Let’s do it on the next page!

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
