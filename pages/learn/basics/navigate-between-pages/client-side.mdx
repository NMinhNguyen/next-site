## Client-Side Navigation

The `Link` component enables **client-side navigation** between two pages in the same Next.js app.

Client-side navigation means that the page transition happens _using JavaScript_, which is faster than the default navigation done by the browser.

Here’s a simple way you can verify:

- Use the browser’s developer tools to change the `background` CSS property of `<html>` to `yellow`.
- Click on the links to go back and forth between the two pages.
- You’ll see that the yellow background persists between page transitions.

This shows that the browser does _not_ load the full page and client-side navigation is working.

<Image
  shadow
  alt="Links"
  oversize={false}
  src="/static/images/learn/navigate-between-pages/client-side.gif"
  width={700 / 1.5}
  height={558 / 1.5}
/>

If you’ve used `<a href="…">` instead of `<Link href="…">` and did this, the background color will be cleared on link clicks because the browser does the full refresh.

### Code splitting and prefetching

Next.js does code splitting automatically so each page only loads what’s necessary for that page. That means when the index page is rendered, the code for other pages are not served initially. This makes the index page load quickly.

Furthermore, in a production build of Next.js, whenever `Link` components appear in the browser’s viewport, Next.js automatically **prefetches** the code for the linked page in the background. By the time you click the link, the destination page will already be loaded in the background, and the page transition will be instant!

You can check this by creating a preview or production deployment on [ZEIT Now](https://zeit.co/). By default, ZEIT Now runs `next build`, which creates an optimized, production build of Next.js.

### Summary

Next.js automatically optimizes your site for the best performance by code splitting, client-side navigation, and prefetching (in production). You just need to create routes as files under `pages` and use `Link`. You don’t need to install extra routing libraries.

You can learn more about the `Link` component <Link href="/docs/[...slug]" as="/docs/api-reference/next/link"><a>here</a></Link> and routing in general <Link href="/docs/[...slug]" as="/docs/routing/introduction"><a>here</a></Link>.

> **Note:** If you need to link to an <em>external</em> page outside the Next.js app, just use an `<a>` tag without `Link`.
>
> If you need to add attributes like `className`, add it to the `a` tag, _not_ to the `Link` tag.
