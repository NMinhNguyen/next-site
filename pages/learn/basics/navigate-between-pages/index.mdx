import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout';

};

So far, the Next.js app we created only have one page. If we’re going to build a build app (here’s the [the final result](https://next-learn-starter.now.sh/)), we need to add more pages. Let’s talk about how to do that in this lesson.

## What You’ll Learn in This Lesson

In this lesson, you will:

- Create a new page in Next.js using its file system routing feature.
- Learn how to use the `Link` component to enable client-side navigation between pages.
- Learn about Next.js’s out of the box support for code splitting and prefetching.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>;
