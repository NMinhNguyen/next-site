You should see a page like this when you access [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). This is the starter template page which shows some helpful information about Next.js.

### Deploy to Production

Now that your Next.js app is up and running locally, let’s **deploy** it to production.

You might be wondering: “But we haven’t even made any changes yet!” That’s ok. You’ll deploy your Next.js app to production at some point anyway, so let’s learn how to do so now!

### Push to GitHub

Before we deploy, let’s push our Next.js app to [GitHub](https://github.com/zeit/next.js) first. This will make deployment easier.

- On your personal GitHub account, create a new repository called `nextjs-blog`. It can be public or private. You do **not** need to initialize it with a README or other files.
- Push the Next.js app you created to this repository.

To push to GitHub, you can use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or run the following commands (replace `<username>` with your GitHub username):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/nextjs-blog.git
git push -u origin master
```

Once your GitHub repository is ready, continue to the next page.
