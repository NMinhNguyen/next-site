You should see a comment by the `now` bot on the pull request page. If you wait for a bit, the comment will turn into something like this:

<Image
  shadow
  alt="Preview Deployment URL"
  oversize={false}
  src="/static/images/learn/create-nextjs-app/now-bot.png"
  width={1231 / 2}
  height={388 / 2}
/>

Try clicking on the **Preview** URL. You should see the changes you just made.

### Preview Deployment for Every Push

When you have a pull request open, ZEIT Now automatically creates a **preview deployment** for that branch on every push. The preview URL will always point to the latest preview deployment.

You can share this preview URL with your collaborators and get immediate feedback.

### Merge to `master` to deploy to production

If your preview deployment looks good, **merge it to `master`**.

When you do this, ZEIT Now automatically creates a production deployment. You should be able to access it via the same production URL we used earlier:

`nextjs-blog.<zeit-username>.now.sh`

That’s it!

### Develop, Preview, Ship

We’ve just gone through the workflow we call **DPS**: **D**evelop, **P**review, and **S**hip.

- **Develop**: We’ve written code in Next.js and used the Next.js development server running to take advantage of its hot reloading feature.
- **Preview**: We’ve pushed changes to a branch on GitHub, and ZEIT Now created a preview deployment that’s available via a URL. We can share this preview URL with others for feedback. In addition to doing _code reviews_, you can do _deployment previews_.
- **Ship**: We’ve merged the pull request to `master` to ship to production.

We strongly recommend using this workflow when developing Next.js apps — it will help you iterate on your app faster.

### Next Up: Creating Pages

That’s it for the first lesson. In the next lesson, we’ll talk about _creating more pages and navigating between pages_.

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
