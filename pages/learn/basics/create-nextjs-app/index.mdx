To build complete web applications with React many tools have to come together.

For example, code has to be bundled using a bundler like webpack and transformed using a compiler like Babel.

There are many other pieces needed to make a successful application, such as code-splitting and production optimizations.

One of the most important parts is "Developer Experience": Ensuring you and your team have an amazing experience while writing code.

For example through hot reloading, which are live updates as you make changes without having to reload the page.

Furthermore, there are many strategies in which websites and applications are being built today, for example statically pre-rendering, server-rendering and client-side only rendering.

All of these problems need very specific solutions.

Next.js is the framework for React. It provides a solution to the mentioned problems, but most importantly it puts you and your team in the pit of success when building React applications.

Next.js has many built-in features, a sample of them are:

- An intuitive page-based routing system (with support for dynamic routes)
- Pre-rendering, both static generation (SSG) and server-rendering (SSR) are supported on a per-page basis
- Automatic code splitting for faster page loads
- Client-side routing with optimized prefetching
- Built-in CSS and Sass support, and support for any CSS-in-JS library
- Development environment which supports Hot Module Replacement
- API routes to build API endpoints with serverless functions
- Fully extendable

Next.js is used in tens of thousands of production-facing websites and web applications. Including many of the world's largest brands.

This interactive course will guide you through how to get started with Next.js and the main components and features for you to know about when building Next.js applications.
