The easiest way to deploy Next.js to production is to use the **[ZEIT Now platform](https://zeit.co)** developed by the creators of Next.js. We believe ZEIT Now is the optimal place to deploy frontend apps. You can start using it for _free_ — no credit card required.

### Create a ZEIT Now Account

First, go to [https://zeit.co/signup](https://zeit.co/signup) to create a ZEIT Now account. Choose **Continue with GitHub** and go through the sign up process.

### Import your `nextjs-blog` repository

Once you’re signed up, **import** your `nextjs-blog` repository on ZEIT Now. You can do so from here: [https://zeit.co/import/git](https://zeit.co/import/git).

- You’ll need to **Install Now for GitHub**. You can give access to **All Repositories**.
- Once you’ve installed Now, import `nextjs-blog`.

You can use _default values_ for the following settings — no need to change anything. ZEIT Now automatically detects that you have a Next.js app and chooses optimal build settings for you.

- Project Name
- Root Directory
- Build Command
- Output Directory
- Development Command

When you click **Deploy**, your Next.js app will start building. It should finish in under a minute.

> **Help is available**: If your deployment fails, you can always get help on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/discussions). To learn more about deployment,

When it’s done, you’ll get deployment URLs ending with `now.sh`. Click on the URL that looks like below — this is the **production domain** assigned to your app:

`nextjs-blog.<zeit-username>.now.sh`

…and you should see the Next.js starter page live.

Congratulations! You just deployed your Next.js app to production. To learn more about other deployment options, <Link href="/docs/[...slug]" as="/docs/deployment"><a>check out our documentation</a></Link>.
