import Layout from '../../../../components/learn/Layout'
import Image from '../../../../components/image'

export const meta = {
  title: 'Create a Next.js App',
  courseId: 'basics',
  lessonId: 'create-nextjs-app',
  stepId: 'editing-the-page',
  subtitle: 'Editing the page',

}

Let’s try to edit the starter page.

First, make sure the Next.js development server is still running. If not, you can start it using the following command.

```bash
npm run dev
```

> You can press <kbd>Ctrl + c</kbd> to stop the server.

### Create a new branch

Before we start editing, let’s create a new **Git branch**. You can use GitHub Desktop or use the following command from a new Terminal window. You can use any branch name.

```bash
git checkout -b edit-starter-page
```

You might think creating a branch is unnecessary, but you’ll soon see why this is helpful.

### Edit the Page

Let’s try editing this page.

- Open `pages/index.js` with your text editor.
- Find the text that says **“Welcome to”** under the `<h1>` tag and change it to **“Learn”**.
- Save the file.

As soon as you save the file, the browser automatically reloads and updates the page with the new text:

<Image
  shadow
  alt="Learn Next.js"
  oversize={false}
  src="/static/images/learn/create-nextjs-app/learn-nextjs.png"
  width={1030 / 2}
  height={384 / 2}
/>

The Next.js development server has the **Hot Reloading** feature which monitors file changes and automatically updates the browser.

### Push and Open a Pull Request

Let’s open a pull request:

- Commit and push the changes to GitHub.
- Open a pull request using this branch.

**Question**: When you open a pull request, you should notice something new that appears on the pull request page. Which of the following is it?

export default ({ children }) => <Layout meta={meta}>{children}</Layout>
